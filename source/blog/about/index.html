<p>My main focus is to create a vibrant work environment where every member of a development team delights in their own contribution. As a seasoned veteran of <a href = "http://amazon.com">high-transactional website</a> development, I have a wealth of experience working with a variety of teams (agile and fragile). I combine lean and agile principles with leading edge technology and tidbits of philosophical wisdom to form an approach to software development that helps teams flourish. <a href="http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2012/PR17.12E.html">I love anything to do with the mysteries of outer space.</a> I'm also a vegan who loves to cook, play a few chords on the guitar and sing off-key when no one's listening. I have produced, directed and edited a number of little known <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3664487/">documentary</a> and art films.</p>
